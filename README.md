# Cracking the code interview questions

### These are implementations of questions asked in the book "Cracking the Code Interview" by Gayle Laakmann Mcdowell. It will periodically be updated as I solve challenges presented in the book

### Purpose:
I hoped to create more "relatable" implementations of certain questtions, as oftentimes the answers given in the book were very good, had highly optimized runtimes, and are indicative of someone who has at least a year or two dev experience.
